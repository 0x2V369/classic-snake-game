# Classic Snake Game

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Snake game. The project is a nostalgic tribute to the iconic Snake game, with some enhancements and customizations.

## Project Overview

The Snake game involves controlling a snake to eat food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer, and the goal is to survive as long as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `snake_game.py` file to launch the game.
2. **Controls**:
   - Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
   - Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's body.
3. **Objective**: Eat the food that appears randomly on the screen to grow the snake. Try to achieve the highest score possible!
